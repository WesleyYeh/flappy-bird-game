## Implementation

This project is built with the open-source library SFML. In this project, one should execute it under Code::Blocks, one of the open-source IDE available on the Internet. All of the code inside the project is implemented using the APIs in SFML libraries. All the game-building materials are collected in the "Resources" file. One can directly change the different game-building blocks in the "Definition.hpp" to alter the game setting.
